# DiscordUtils: Ghosting, simplified.

## Introduction

`DiscordUtils` is a plugin for Discord that "enhances" your friend ghosting experience.

## Features

### Delay Sending a Message 

If you wish to delay the sending of a message, use the `!tr` command followed by the delay in seconds, and then the message. For example, `!tr 5 Hello World!` will send "Hello World!" after a delay of 5 seconds.
Usage: `!tr` `delay [SECONDS]` `message`


### Send Multiple Messages with a Delay

To send multiple messages with a delay between each one, use the `!and` command followed by the delay in seconds and then the messages, separated by commas. For example, `!and 3 Hello, How are you?, Goodbye!` will send "Hello", "How are you?", and "Goodbye!" with a delay of 3 seconds between each message.

### Send a Message at a Particular Time

You can schedule a message to be sent at a particular time with the `!trd` command. For example, `!trd 12:30 It's lunchtime!` will send "It's lunchtime!" at 12:30.

### Integrated with OpenAI's GPT-3 API

The plugin also includes an integration with OpenAI's GPT-3 API. If you reply to a message with `!chrep`, the bot will use the replied message as input to the GPT-3 API and send the response as a message, and is capable of using the commands above to automatically respond to your friends' needs. Please note that this requires a valid API key.

### Stackable Commands

Commands provided by the DelayMessage plugin are stackable, allowing you to mix and match them for more complex interactions. For example, you can schedule a message to be sent at a particular time and also specify that it should automatically reply to a certain message with GPT-3.

## Limitations/ Known Issues

1. Awful textbox message handling
2. Delayed messages do not support attachments
3. Stacking delays breaks textbox messages

## Planned features

"!config" command which lets you quickly change settings like your GPT-3 API key
